# Hoop Spots

### Mission
Find the best pickup basketball hoop sessions in real time using HoopSpots.

### Problem
Finding consistent hoop sessions is hard.  The current solution is to either text everyone you know and asking the question ”Are you hooping?” or create a group chat with a bunch of hoopers which will almost 100% always fizzle out due to off topic conversations.

### Solution
HoopSpots will allow you to find available hoop sessions at a specific location. You can invite friends to a hoop session and see the hoopers on a map in real time (similar to Snapchat maps).

### Technology
#### API
The API is built using Laravel, and can be found [here](https://github.com/HoopSpots/api)

#### Web
The web application will be built with Next.js and is the repo you're currently looking at

#### Native
The native application will be built with React Native at some point...
